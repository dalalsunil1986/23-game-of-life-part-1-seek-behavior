# ReactU Episode #23

## Series: Steering Behaviors in JavaSript

### Part 1: Implementing a basic Seek behavior

In this episode we will be setting up a world for our creatures (specimens) and food (edibles) to live in! We will wire up Redux to handle the state, create some physics objects (Specimen, Food, and Entity) and use class inheritance to apply common functionality.

We will also create a Vector class from scratch to describe the Euler math to our game engine to handle the positioning and movement of our entities. Finally we will implement the seek behavior so our specimens will traverse across the world (canvas) to reach the food they want to eat!
